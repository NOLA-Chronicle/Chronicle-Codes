					<td>This bot was inspired by the Tik Tok trend of publishing videos with interesting backwards sounds and/or videos to accompany them. This bot is meant to be used to easily reverse the video that was posted so that users do not have to go through the troubles and tribulations of doing it themselves.<br>
