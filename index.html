				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMy name is Ryan Johnson. I have a BS in Computer Information Systems and I'm currently pursuing a MS in the same degree of study. I'm a software applications and web developer and love to work on various projects ranging in programming language and difficulty. My hobbies are all over the place, but my first <strong>BIG</strong> hobby was web development, which then grew to software development with C++ and Java. Today, my expertise also includes VB.NET, C#, Python, and Robotic Process Automation work. I hope to hone my skills enough to develop a marketable video game. Thank you for visiting my site, and I hope you enjoy!</p>
